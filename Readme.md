# Final Project
Class: CS-315-1: Distributed Scalable Computing   
Last Modified: 11/29/2022

## Overview
The goal of the final project is to show off what you have learned this semester. Rather than give a final exam, we would rather see you use your analytical and critical thinking abilities expressed towards problem solving using parallel computing. 

This document outlines the basic expectations for the project. You are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond. Work beyond these expectations may possibly earn extra credit points.

NOTE: Overall this will be 25% of your total grade for this class. 

## General Requirements
For this project, you can use any programming language you would like. However, the following requirements must be met:
* Using parallel computing
* Use appropriate code formatting and application of functions
* Use appropriate data types and structures for the problem at hand
  
  
## Timelines
* Proposal: by 12/1/2022
* Presentation: 8:30 - 10:00 AM on 12/13/2022
* Submission: by 23:59 on 12/13/2022 

## Outlines
### Step 0: Organize as a Group and Decide on a Project

One of the most important skills you should learn during college is how to work with others effectively, both in groups and person to person. Here are some general rules that apply:
* Treating your group partner(s) the way you wish to be treated. 
* Listening carefully and listening well.
* Thinking objectively when speaking.
* Following through on agreed and scheduled meetings (and communicating in an emergency)
* Practice diplomacy when discussing problematic issues or code. Instead of pointing blame, focus on listening, finding, and fixing issues.

In addition, since this project will be completed as a group, all code will be written utilizing pair programming, this means that:
* All group members should read this paper: https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Kindergarten.PDF
* All group members must be present and actively engaged when working on the design or code implementation. 
* Decide as a group how the rest of the work should be evenly divided among the group members and how all group members will review all work before submitting it.
* Reliability in attending meetings and participation will all be a part of your final grade for this project. 
  
All documents will be submitted via Whitgit. You and your partner have access to a group project folder.


### Step 1: Write a Project Proposal 
Each group should make a one-page project proposal to your instructor before proceeding with development. Your professor will then do one of three things: 

* Approve your project as proposed.
* Make suggestions on how to make your project more rigorous (if your approach was too easy)
* Make suggestions on how to make your project easier (if your problem was too hard)

Please email me the proposal by 12/1/2022 (Thursday).

### Step 2: Implement and Test Your Project
As with all code turned in for this class, the same rules apply here for this final project. 
* You will be graded on proper coding style. 
* Your code must be readable, properly formatted, and must have good comments describing what is going on. 
* Use proper indentation.
* Variable names should descriptive and make sense. 
* Functions names should be obvious and descriptive. 
* At this point in your CS career you should be able to take advantage proper code re-use and functionalization. 
    1. Each function should only do one thing. If it is doing many things, those should be functionalized.
    2. All functions should be documented with purpose, inputs, and outputs. 
* Your code should match your documentation. All citations should be clearly marked and identified.

### Step 3: Write a Final Project Report 

At a minimum, your final report should contain the following elements:
* The __title__ of your final project program.
* A __short description of the purpose and goals__ of the program.
* What __assumptions__ did you make when working on the project (e.g. knowledge level of users, etc.)?
* A __detailed description of how your code works__. Cite key variables,  functions, (and possibly objects). Specify how they interact with each other. Use pseudo-code to explain the major algorithm(s).
* The result of your program execution and your analyses.
* __Works Cited__ This should includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should also be listed directly in your code.


### Step 4: Final Project Presentation
During the final time for your section, your group will give a presentation on the work that you accomplished. Each group will be presenting for about 15 mins.

* Prepare slides for your presentation.
* Your presentation should outline your project and what it does. As your project may be complicated, you don't necessarily have to cover every line of code. You should be able to highlight the main processing features and classes.
* Your presentation can include a demonstration if you feel it will aid in understanding the project.
* Your presentation should clearly identify the path forward for the project and the major problems that were encountered and how you overcame them.
* Make sure all group members participate in the presentation.
